        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <h3>Effective Date: July 6, 2025</h3>
        <h3>Last Updated: July 6, 2025</h3>
        <p>This Privacy Policy describes how Slime Bot (the "Bot") operated by Hanyang Zhou ("we", "us", or "our") handles information in connection with the Bot’s operation on the Discord platform.</p>
        <h2>Definitions</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>"Discord" refers to Discord Inc., including its subsidiaries and affiliated entities.</li>
            <li>"Slime Bot" or "the Bot" refers to the Discord bot developed and maintained by Hanyang Zhou that operates within the Discord platform.</li>
            <li>"Developer," "we," "us," or "our" refers to Hanyang Zhou, the individual creator and operator of Slime Bot.</li>
            <li>"you" or "your" means you, the user accessing or interacting with Slime Bot. If you are accessing or using the Bot on behalf of a legal entity, you represent that you have the authority to bind that entity.</li>
            <li>"Services" refers to all functionality, features, and interactions provided through Slime Bot.</li>
            <li>"User Content" means any data, messages, media, or other content submitted, generated, or made available by users through Slime Bot’s features.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Data Collection</h2>
        <p>Slime Bot does <strong>not</strong> collect, store, or share any personally identifiable information (PII). The Bot processes only the data required to respond to commands and perform its intended functionality within Discord.</p>
        <h2>User Content</h2>
        <p>While Slime Bot may interact with messages or content you send via Discord, such interactions are ephemeral and not logged or stored by the Developer. Any analysis or behavior based on User Content is computed at runtime and discarded afterward.</p>
        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>Slime Bot primarily operates within the Discord platform. However, it may use external services such as MongoDB for data storage and internal functionality. These services are used solely to support features of the Bot and do not involve the collection or processing of personally identifiable information. No data is sold, shared, or transmitted to advertisers or analytics providers.</p>
        <h2>Cookies and Tracking</h2>
        <p>Slime Bot does not use cookies, tracking pixels, or similar technologies. No cross-site tracking or data profiling occurs.</p>
        <h2>Your Rights</h2>
        <p>Because the Bot does not collect or store personal data, there is no mechanism for you to request access to, correction of, or deletion of such data. If you have concerns, you may stop interacting with the Bot at any time.</p>
        <h2>Security</h2>
        <p>We take reasonable technical measures to ensure the integrity and security of the Bot’s code and behavior, but cannot guarantee complete protection against exploitation of the Discord platform or other users.</p>
        <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. Continued use of Slime Bot after changes are posted will indicate your acknowledgment and acceptance of those changes.</p>
